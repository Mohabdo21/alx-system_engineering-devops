# 0x0E. Web stack debugging #1

This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. The main objective is to understand and implement the concepts of web stack debugging. This project involves the use of DevOps, SysAdmin, Scripting, and Debugging practices.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to improve our web stack debugging skills. Debugging is a methodical process of finding and reducing the number of bugs, or defects, in a computer program or a piece of electronic hardware, thus making it behave as expected. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.

For this project, we write Bash scripts to automate the debugging process. All scripts designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu servers to match the tasks requirements.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of network basics and its importance in DevOps and SysAdmin.
- Learn about web stack debugging and how to use it to solve problems in a web stack.
- Understand how to use Bash scripts to automate debugging tasks.
- Learn how to use various debugging tools and techniques to debug a web stack.

## Concepts

- **Network basics**: Understanding how data is sent and received in a network is fundamental to being able to configure and debug a web stack.
- **Web stack debugging**: This is the process of tracking down and fixing errors and problems in a web stack. This can involve issues with the web server, application server, database, and so on.
