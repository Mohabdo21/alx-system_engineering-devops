**1. Additional Servers:**
Adding two more servers to the infrastructure helps distribute the load and reduce the risk of a single point of failure (SPOF).
This enhances the system's ability to handle increased traffic and provides redundancy in case one server fails.

**2. Load Balancer (HAproxy):**
The load balancer's role is to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.
This helps optimize resource use, reduce response time, and increase the reliability of applications.

**3. Distribution Algorithm:**
The load balancer could use a round-robin algorithm, which distributes requests sequentially to servers in a circular order.
This method ensures that all servers share the load equally.

**4. Active-Active vs Active-Passive Setup:**
In an active-active setup, all servers are handling traffic, providing maximum resource utilization.
In an active-passive setup, one server is active and the others are on standby, providing a backup in case the active server fails.

**5. Database Primary-Replica Cluster:**
In a primary-replica setup, the primary node handles write operations and the replica nodes handle read operations.
This separation of duties can enhance performance by allowing read and write operations to be processed concurrently.

**6. Primary Node vs Replica Node:**
The primary node can handle both read and write operations, while the replica node only handles read operations.
This allows the primary node to focus on processing write operations without being slowed down by read requests.


## The potential issues with this infrastructure:

**1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
Even with multiple servers, there could still be SPOFs. For example, if the load balancer goes down,
the entire system could become unavailable.

**2. Security Issues:**
Without a firewall or HTTPS, the system is vulnerable to attacks. Proper security measures should be implemented
to protect the system and its data.

**3. No Monitoring:**
Without monitoring, it's hard to identify and fix issues promptly. Monitoring tools can provide valuable insights
into system performance and help detect problems before they affect users.
