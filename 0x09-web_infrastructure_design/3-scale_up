1. **Additional Server:**
Incorporating an additional server into the infrastructure can enhance system performance and reliability
by distributing the load across multiple servers. This also reduces the risk of a single point of failure (SPOF),
thereby increasing system resilience.

2. **Load Balancer (HAproxy) Cluster:**
Configuring an additional HAproxy in a cluster with the existing one provides high availability and failover support.
In the event of a failure of one load balancer, the other can seamlessly take over, ensuring uninterrupted service availability.

3. **Split Components:**
Segregating the web server, application server, and database onto their own dedicated servers can optimize system performance
and simplify management. Each server can be fine-tuned for its specific task, leading to more efficient resource utilization.
Moreover, this separation allows for easier isolation and resolution of issues, enhancing system maintainability.
