**1. Additional Server:**
The integration of an additional server into the infrastructure significantly enhances system performance
and reliability. This strategy effectively distributes the load across multiple servers, thereby reducing
the risk of a single point of failure (SPOF) and bolstering system resilience.

**2. Load Balancer (HAproxy) Cluster:**
The configuration of an additional HAproxy in a cluster with the existing one ensures high availability
and failover support. In the event of a failure of one load balancer, the other can seamlessly assume control,
guaranteeing uninterrupted service availability.

**3. Component Segregation:**
The segregation of the web server, application server, and database onto their own dedicated servers
optimizes system performance and simplifies management.
Each server can be fine-tuned for its specific task, leading to more efficient resource utilization.
Furthermore, this separation facilitates easier isolation and resolution of issues, thereby enhancing
system maintainability. This approach ensures that each component is optimized for its specific role,
leading to improved overall system performance.
