**1. Server:**
A server is a powerful computer that provides a centralized location for data storage and application hosting.

**2. Domain Name:**
The domain name (foobar.com) serves as the unique identifier or address for the website on the internet.

**3. DNS Record:**
The 'www' in 'www.foobar.com' is a type of DNS record known as a CNAME (Canonical Name), which is used to alias one name to another.

**4. Web Server (Nginx):**
The web server (Nginx) processes user requests and serves web pages to the user's browser.

**5. Application Server:**
The application server hosts the business logic for web applications and generates dynamic content based on user requests.

**6. Database (MySQL):**
The database (MySQL) stores and manages data that the application server needs to generate dynamic content.

**7. Communication:**
The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.


## The potential issues with this infrastructure:

**1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
Since everything is hosted on a single server, if that server goes down, the entire website becomes unavailable.

**2. Downtime for Maintenance:**
When new code is deployed or the web server needs to be restarted, the website will be temporarily unavailable.

**3. Scalability:**
If the website receives too much traffic, a single server may not be able to handle the load, leading to performance issues or downtime.
