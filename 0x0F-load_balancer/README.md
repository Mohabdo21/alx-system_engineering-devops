This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. The main objective is to understand and implement the concepts of load balancing. This project involves the use of DevOps, SysAdmin, Scripting, and Configuration Management practices.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to improve our web stack by adding redundancy for our web servers. This will allow us to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, we write Bash scripts to automate the configuration work. All scripts designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu servers to match the tasks requirements.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of load balancing and its importance in DevOps.
- Learn about HAProxy and how to use it for load balancing.
- Understand how to use Bash scripts to automate configuration tasks.
