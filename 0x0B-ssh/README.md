# 0x0B. SSH

This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. The main objective is to understand and implement the concepts of SSH, servers, and security in DevOps.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what a server is and where servers usually live.
- Learn about SSH (Secure Shell) and its importance in network security.
- Understand how to create an SSH RSA key pair.
- Learn how to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair.
- Understand the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`.

## Topics Covered

This project covers a range of topics in DevOps, networking, system administration, and security. These include:

- **Servers**: What they are, their role in the digital infrastructure, and typical locations for server deployment.
- **SSH**: An introduction to Secure Shell (SSH), a cryptographic network protocol used for secure connection to remote servers.
- **SSH RSA Key Pair**: Instructions on how to create and use an SSH RSA key pair for secure communication.
- **Shebangs**: The benefits of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` as a shebang line in bash scripts, compared to `/bin/bash`.
