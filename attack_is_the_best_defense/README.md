# Attack is the Best Defense

This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. The main objective is to understand and implement the concepts of DevOps, Scripting, and Hacking. This project involves the use of network sniffing, ARP spoofing, connecting to SendGrid's SMTP relay using telnet, understanding Docker and its popularity, and performing dictionary attacks.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of network sniffing and its importance in hacking.
- Learn about ARP spoofing and how it can be used in network attacks.
- Understand how to connect to SendGrid's SMTP relay using telnet.
- Learn what Docker is and why it is popular in the DevOps community.
- Understand how to perform a dictionary attack.

## Man or Help

- `tcpdump`: This tool is used for network sniffing. It can capture and analyze network traffic.
- `hydra`: This is a powerful tool used for dictionary attacks. It can crack passwords by trying a list of possible passwords.
- `telnet`: This is a user command and an underlying TCP/IP protocol for accessing remote computers.
- `docker`: This is a popular platform used to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It uses containerization technology.
