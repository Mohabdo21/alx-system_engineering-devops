**Issue Summary:**

On April 7, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM (GMT+04:00), our primary **MySQL** database experienced an outage. This resulted in approximately 35% of our users experiencing slow response times or timeouts when attempting to access our **Django** web application. The root cause was a misconfiguration in the **MySQL Replication** process.

**Timeline:**

- **10:00 AM**: The issue was detected by our **Datadog** monitoring system which alerted us to high latency and error rates.\
- **10:05 AM**: Initial investigation by the on-call engineer indicated that the primary database was under heavy load.\
- **10:15 AM**: The issue was escalated to the database team.\
- **10:20 AM**: Initial assumption was a sudden spike in traffic, but further investigation ruled this out.\
- **10:45 AM**: The database team identified a misconfiguration in the **MySQL Replication** process that was causing excessive load.\
- **11:30 AM**: A fix was implemented and the system began to recover.\
- **12:30 PM**: The system was confirmed to be back at full capacity.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the **MySQL Replication** process. This misconfiguration caused the primary **MySQL** database to attempt to replicate data to a non-existent replica, resulting in excessive load and subsequent performance issues.

The issue was resolved by correcting the **MySQL Replication** configuration and restarting the **MySQL** service. This allowed the replication process to function correctly and alleviated the excessive load on the primary database.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

To prevent this issue from recurring, we will be implementing several improvements:

- Improve our **Puppet** configuration management to prevent misconfigurations.\
- Enhance our **Datadog** monitoring to detect replication issues more quickly.\
- Conduct regular audits of our **MySQL** database configuration using **MySQL Workbench**.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**

1\. Update **Puppet** configuration management scripts to validate **MySQL Replication** configuration before deployment.\
2\. Add additional **Datadog** monitoring and alerting for **MySQL** database replication metrics.\
3\. Schedule a bi-weekly audit of **MySQL** configurations using **MySQL Workbench**.

This incident has been a valuable learning experience for our team and we are committed to improving our systems and processes to prevent similar issues in the future.
