# 0x10. HTTPS SSL

This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. The main objective is to understand and implement the concepts of HTTPS and SSL. This project involves the use of DevOps, SysAdmin, Security practices.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to secure our web stack by implementing HTTPS and SSL. This will allow us to encrypt the traffic between our web servers and the clients, enhancing the security of our infrastructure. If a third party intercepts the traffic, they will not be able to understand it because it is encrypted.

For this project, we write Bash scripts to automate the configuration work. All scripts designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu servers to match the tasks requirements.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the two main roles of HTTPS SSL: Authentication and Encryption.
- Learn about the purpose of encrypting traffic and its importance in web security.
- Understand what SSL termination means and where it happens in your infrastructure.
- Learn how to use Bash scripts to automate configuration tasks.
- Learn how to use curl to interact with web servers.
